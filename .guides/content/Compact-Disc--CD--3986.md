The main formats of CD are the following:

**Compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM)**
Data is written only once to a compact disc but it can be replayed any number of times.

**Recordable CDs**
A laser beam in a CD drive stores or burns data onto the surface of a CD and is also used to read data from the disc.

Two types of recordable CDs are:

**CD-Recordable (CD-R)** 
Data can be stored on this type of CD and can be added until the disc is full.  However, data cannot be erased from the CD and the disc cannot be re-used.


**CD ReWritable (CD-RW)**
Data can be stored on this type of CD and more data can be added to it.  Data can also be deleted from the disc.  It can be read and written to a limited number of times.
